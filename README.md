## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm a frontend developer who has a results-focused attitude to creating SPA, using React(JS/TS), Redux.
#### My free time is dedicated to Codewars, programming tutorials, and becoming familiar with NodeJS, because, in the future, I see myself as a Full Stack Developer.
#### I would like to find project work and full-time employment in a company with a modern approach to development and a collaborative team.
